1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Agents are the new apps.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 And we expect some day for there to be thousands of agents available.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 We want a thousand agents to bloom.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 So I think we're going to live in a world where there are going to be hundreds of millions

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 of billions of different AI agents.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Eventually, probably more AI agents than there are people in the world.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 For the very first time, this is going to be an industry of skills.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And you capture that phrase and you call it agents.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 But it's going to be for the very first time agents sitting on top of tools.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 If you're here, it's probably because you've been hearing a lot about AI agents lately.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Maybe you've even checked out some other videos that go way too technical.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 And you thought, why don't you explain this to me like I'm five?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Well, guess what?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 That's exactly what I'm going to do.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm going to give you the most straightforward real world explanation of what an AI agent is.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So what is it?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 You probably already know that AI stands for artificial intelligence.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 But here's where it gets interesting.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 AI by itself is like raw brain power.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 It's got all this potential, but it's not really useful until you give it a job.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Enter the AI agent.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Think of AI as the genius with a million ideas and the AI agent is the one who actually gets stuff done.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 While AI is all about smarts, an AI agent is the practical hands on version.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It's like giving that genius a toss and saying, OK, now go do something useful with all that brain power.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 The AI agent takes the intelligence of AI and turns it into action, whether it's answering your questions,

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 automating your work, or handling your to do list.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 It's the difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So while AI is the brains, the AI agent is the one rolling up its sleeves and making things happen.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Here is the one, two, three of AI agents.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Number one, they understand AI agents listen to what you're asking or needing.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Number two, they think.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 They process this information and figure out the best way to help you.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And number three, they act.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Finally, they deliver what you need, whether it's an answer, a solution, or help completing a task.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Now how do they work?

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Imagine your parents are heading out for the evening and leaving the babysitter in charge.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Remember, you're only five.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 They don't just walk out the door.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 They give them instructions.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 What time you need to go to bed.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 What you can have for a snack and what to do in case of an emergency.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 That's exactly how AI agents are trained.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Developers provide these agents with detailed instructions using data so they know exactly how to respond in different situations.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Some agents come pre-programmed with basic instructions, like a babysitter who's already experienced.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Others can be customized to fit your needs, like giving the babysitter special rules for kids.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Once set up, these AI agents handle tasks just as smoothly as a well-informed babysitter, freeing you up to focus on other things.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 So what does an AI agent actually look like?

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 When we talk about what an AI agent looks like, it's helpful to think of it as a combination of two things.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 An interface and a workflow.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 The interface is how you interact with the AI agent, maybe through a chat window,

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 a voice assistant, or even a button on a website.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 But behind that interface is where the real magic happens, and that's the workflow.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Imagine a flow chart.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 You ask the AI agent a question or give it a command through the interface.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 That's the starting point.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 From there, the AI agent follows a series of steps or nodes in a workflow.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 These nodes could involve accessing information from a database,

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 making a decision based on what it finds, or even performing a task like sending an email.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 The nodes in this workflow might change depending on what you ask or what the AI agent needs to do next,

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 but it's all behind the scenes.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 So while you only see the interface, what's really happening is that the AI agent is working through a whole process to get you the best result.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Now here's a simple four step illustration of that process.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 The first is the input.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 You ask a question or give a command.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 The second is processing.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 The AI agent thinks about what you've asked and searches for the best way to respond.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Number three is action.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 The AI agent gives you an answer, finds information, or performs a task.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And fourth is learning.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 The more you use it, the smarter it gets.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Learning from past interactions to improve.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So why is it important?

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 AI agents are about to trigger a seismic shift in how we live and work, especially for local businesses and those who support them.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Imagine AI handling routine tasks, freeing business owners to focus on growth and innovation.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 For local businesses, this could mean smarter customer service and more efficient operations,

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 while agencies and service providers can deliver more value with less effort.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 This isn't just like another tech upgrade.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 It's likely the biggest transformation we'll see in our lifetime.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Those who embrace AI agents now will have a major advantage.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 While those who don't risk being left behind in a rapidly changing world.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 In short, AI agents are set to revolutionize how work gets done and the impact will be massive.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I hope this video helped you learn the basics of AI in a way that's easy to understand.
